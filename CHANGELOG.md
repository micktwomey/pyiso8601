## [0.1.9] - 2014-02-26

- Release addresses https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/13/new-release-based-on-critical-bug-fix

## [0.1.8] - 2013-10-22

- Remove +/- chars from README.rst and ensure tox tests run using LC_ALL=C. The setup.py egg_info command was failing in python 3.* on some setups (basically any where the system encoding wasn't UTF-8). (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/10/setuppy-broken-for-python-33) (thanks to klmitch)

## [0.1.7] - 2013-10-19

## [0.1.6] - 2013-10-18
### Fixed
- Correct negative timezone offsets (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/8/015-parses-negative-timezones-incorrectly) (thanks to Jonathan Lange)

## [0.1.5] - 2013-10-17
### Added
- Add support for python 3. https://code.google.com/p/pyiso8601/issues/detail?id=23 (thanks to zefciu)

### Changed
- Wow, it's alive! First update since 2007
- Moved over to https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601
- Switched to py.test and tox for testing
- Make seconds optional in date format ("1997-07-16T19:20+01:00" now valid). https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/pull-request/1/make-the-inclusion-of-seconds-optional-in/diff (thanks to Chris Down)
- Support more variations of ISO 8601 dates, times and time zone specs.
- "Z" produces default timezone if one is specified (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/5/z-produces-default-timezone-if-one-is) (thanks to vfaronov). This one may cause problems if you've been relying on default_timezone to use that timezone instead of UTC. Strictly speaking that was wrong but this is potentially backwards incompatible.
- Handle compact date format (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/6/handle-compact-date-format) (thanks to rvandolson@esri.com)

### Fixed
- Correctly raise ParseError for more invalid inputs (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/1/raise-parseerror-for-invalid-input) (thanks to manish.tomar)
- Fix microsecond rounding issues (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/2/roundoff-issues-when-parsing-decimal) (thanks to nielsenb@jetfuse.net)
- Fix pickling and deepcopy of returned datetime objects (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/3/dates-returned-by-parse_date-do-not) (thanks to fogathmann and john@openlearning.com)
- Fix timezone offsets without a separator (https://bitbucket.org/micktwomey/pyiso8601/issue/4/support-offsets-without-a-separator) (thanks to joe.walton.gglcd)

## [0.1.4] - 2007-09-18
### Fixed
- The default_timezone argument wasn't being passed through correctly, UTC was being used in every case. Fixes issue 10.

## [0.1.3] - 2007-08-28
### Fixed
- Fixed the microsecond handling, the generated microsecond values were way too small. Fixes issue 9.

## [0.1.2] - 2007-07-24
### Added
- Adding ParseError to __all__ in iso8601 module, allows people to import it. Addresses issue 7.

### Changed
- Allow date/time separators other than T.
- Be a little more flexible when dealing with dates without leading zeroes. This violates the spec a little, but handles more dates as seen in the field. Addresses issue 6.

## [0.1.1] - 2007-03-30
### Changed
- When parsing dates without a timezone the specified default is used. If no default is specified then UTC is used. Addresses issue 4.

## [0.1.0] - 2007-01-04
### Added
- First release
